# Tools for DCN API Specification

Utilities for validating, bundling, and generating SDKs for the  
**Decentralised Creative Network (DCN)** protocol.

The `tools/` directory contains all auxiliary scripts and configuration files  
required to maintain API consistency, perform contract linting, validate  
OpenAPI structure, and automate SDK code generation.

These tools run locally and inside CI pipelines to guarantee that all DCN  
services follow shared standards.
